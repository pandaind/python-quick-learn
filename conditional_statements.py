# Conditional Statements

# Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

# Example:
temperature = 30

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a hot day")
elif temperature > 15:
    print("It's a warm day")
else:
    print("It's a cold day")

# Interview Tip:
# Be prepared to explain the difference between `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

# Common Interview Question:
# How does Python handle indentation in conditional statements?
# Python uses indentation to define the scope of conditional statements.
