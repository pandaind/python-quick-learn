# Operators and Expressions

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.333...
print(a % b)  # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000
print(a // b) # Floor Division: 3

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b)  # Equal: False
print(a != b)  # Not Equal: True
print(a > b)   # Greater Than: True
print(a < b)   # Less Than: False
print(a >= b)  # Greater Than or Equal: True
print(a <= b)  # Less Than or Equal: False

# Logical Operators
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Logical AND: False
print(x or y)   # Logical OR: True
print(not x)    # Logical NOT: False

# Interview Tip:
# Be ready to explain operator precedence and associativity in Python.

# Common Interview Question:
# What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?
# `is` checks for object identity, while `==` checks for value equality.
