# Variables and Data Types

# Variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable.

# Example:
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 25        # Integer
height = 5.5    # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean

# You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(age))   # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(height))  # Output: <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

# Interview Tip:
# Be prepared to explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.
# Mutable: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets
# Immutable: Strings, Tuples, Integers, Floats

# Common Interview Question:
# What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?
# `is` checks for object identity, while `==` checks for value equality.
